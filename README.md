# ü§ñ PDP AI: LLM-generated for Merchandisers

PDP AI: LLM-generated for Merchandisers is a Chrome extension that uses Google's Gemini AI to analyze and optimize product detail pages (PDPs) for SEO and customer experience. It provides real-time suggestions and allows users to apply changes directly to the page.

## üì¶ Architecture & Workflow

- **Manifest v3**: Secure, modern Chrome extension structure.
- **Service Worker (`background.js`)**: Handles Gemini API calls and workflow.
- **Content Script (`content.js`)**: Bridges extension and page context.
- **DOM Updater (`dom-updater.js`)**: Injected to update the DOM with AI suggestions.
- **Popup UI (`popup.html`, `popup.js`, `popup.css`)**: User interface for analysis and suggestions.
- **Options Page (`options.html`, `options.js`)**: Secure API key management.

### Data Flow
1. User clicks "Analyze Page" in the popup.
2. Page HTML is sent to Gemini API via background script.
3. Suggestions are returned and displayed in the popup.
4. User reviews and applies changes, which are injected into the page.

### Security & Privacy
- API key is stored securely in Chrome local storage.
- Only explicit user actions trigger page changes.
